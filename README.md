# Contextual Shortcuts

## Todo:

* decide what to do when there's no shortcut
  * preferred: icon grayout, don't show the window (this means I'd need to know what current app is before user clicking, and I constantly watch the app usage.)
  * lazy: show a window and ask people to do a pull request
  * scope-creaping: show a form allow user to add their own shortcut file and shortcuts
* make app focus work like native app
* add a list of apps that currently has shortcuts
* add a yml template for people to add more shortcuts
* style/polish the page
* refactor into helper fucntions
* unit test
* code sign and release to app store
* create a marketing webpage
